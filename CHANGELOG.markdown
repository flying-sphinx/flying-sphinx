# Changelog

All notable changes to this project (at least, from v0.4.0 onwards) are documented in this file.

## 2.1.4 - 2019-03-10

### Fixed

* Fixed the overriding of Flying Sphinx connection details by Thinking Sphinx's new prepare hook (added in Thinking Sphinx v4.2.0).

## 2.1.3 - 2018-12-12

### Fixed

* Sinatra loader now works correctly (it had been missed in the other v2 updates).

## 2.1.2 - 2018-06-09

### Fixed

* Does not override Thinking Sphinx rake tasks when in a non-Flying Sphinx environment (as determined by the presence of the FLYING_SPHINX_IDENTIFIER environment variable). This fixed behaviour is the same as pre-v2.0 releases.

## 2.1.1 - 2018-04-30

### Fixed

* Fixed clearing of Delayed Jobs to work with Rails 3+ syntax only ([#19](https://github.com/flying-sphinx/flying-sphinx/pull/19) via [Kiril Mitov](https://github.com/thebravoman)).

## 2.1.0 - 2018-04-20

### Added

* Check Sphinx/Manticore version against what's available on the Flying Sphinx servers as part of the configuration process.

### Changed

* Update gzipped_tar dependency.

## 2.0.0 - 2018-04-10

### Added

* Add support for Manticore (via `engine` setting in config/thinking_sphinx.yml).
* Using Thinking Sphinx v4's new task/command architecture, and so all the ts rake tasks perform the appropriate behaviour on Flying Sphinx.

### Changed

* Dropped support for Thinking Sphinx 3.x or older.
* Dropped support for ActiveRecord/Rails 3.1 or older.
* Dropped support for Ruby 2.1 or older.

## 1.3.1 - 2017-12-04

### Fixed

* Fix call to generate real-time data for thinking-sphinx v3.4+.

## 1.3.0 - 2017-12-04

## 1.1.0 - 2014-03-15

### Added

* Added remote rotate support via custom controller.
* Added regenerate command (for when real-time indices are being used).

### Changed

### Changed

* Daemon actions (start/stop) are now asynchronous.
* More forgiving when environment variables aren't around. Particularly helpful for Padrino and Sinatra.
* Make delta indexing jobs asynchronous - no need to wait for the result. Also, with the different URL, flying-sphinx.com will not queue up duplicate delta jobs within the last 20 minutes if there's a indexing job still pending.

## 0.8.4 - 2012-09-22

### Fixed

* Load the Delta class when loading Rails.

### Changed

* Requires Rails 3 or better (if you're using Rails).
* Load Rails when configuring.

* Verbose logging now has timestamps.

## 0.6.1 - 2011-11-04

## 0.6.0 - 2011-07-31

### Added

* Support for all file-based Sphinx settings: stopwords, wordforms, exceptions, and mysql ssl settings for SQL sources.

### Changed

* Version in a separate file.

## 0.5.2 - 2011-07-28

### Added

* This history file now exists (pre-populated).
* An actual README, courtesy of some prodding by Mislav.
* Added support for wordforms (automatically sent through to the server).

### Changed

## 0.5.1 - 2011-06-23

### Added

* Adding rake as a development dependency, just for Travis CI.
* Sinatra loader (equivalent of a Railtie).

* Using Bundler as gem driver instead of Jeweler (Josh Kalderimis).
* More flexible JSON dependency.

## 0.4.4 - 2011-02-07

### Changed

* Using ActiveRecord's connection information, as we can't rely on heroku_env.yml to be around.

## 0.4.3 - 2011-02-04

### Changed

* Wait until the SSH session and forward is prepared before making the index request.
* If credentials are invalid, raise an appropriate error instead of letting the JSON parsing fail.

## 0.4.2 - 2011-01-29

### Changed

* Set the Thinking Sphinx database adapter when loaded, instead of requiring the Rails dispatcher to setup.

## 0.4.1 - 2011-01-24

## 0.4.0 - 2011-01-18

### Changed

* Using HTTPS for API calls.
* Using Flying Sphinx server's account identifier instead of the heroku id from the environment (the latter being unreliable and not part of any official Heroku add-on documentation).

Note: Any releases before this were most definitely experimental and pre-alpha.
