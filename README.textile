h1. Flying Sphinx

This library is the code behind the @flying-sphinx@ gem. Its sole purpose is to connect Thinking Sphinx to the "Flying Sphinx Heroku addon":http://addons.heroku.com/flying_sphinx - and so you can just use Thinking Sphinx as normal on Heroku-hosted sites.

h2. Installation and Usage

This is all covered pretty well on "the Flying Sphinx site":http://flying-sphinx.com/docs, but if you're reading this on Github, you're probably keen on using this repository as the source instead of the gem. Here's the code snippet for your @Gemfile@:

<pre><code>gem 'flying-sphinx',
  :git    => 'git://github.com/flying-sphinx/flying-sphinx.git',
  :branch => 'master',
  :ref    => '95acb39052'</code></pre>

h2. Compatibility and Limitations

The current (2.x) releases support Thinking Sphinx v4+, ActiveRecord/Rails 3.2+, and Ruby 2.2+.

If you are using older versions of any of these, please use v1.3.1 (which supports Thinking Sphinx v1.5+, ActiveRecord/Rails 2.3.6+, and Ruby 1.9.3+).

If you're still using Ruby 1.8.7, flying-sphinx 1.2.1 is the last release to support that.

h2. Contributing

Patches are indeed welcome - though I understand it's a little tricky to test them thoroughly. It's best to give your changes a spin on your Heroku app that's running Flying Sphinx (and if you don't have one of those, I'm a little confused as to why you're contributing).

API documentation is required - consider this paragraph a placeholder for that.

In the meantime, please keep in mind the following:

* Write tests using RSpec
* Keep your commits in a separate branch
* Don't change the version or History file in your feature branch - makes merging changes much easier.
