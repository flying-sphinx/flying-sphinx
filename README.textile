h1. Flying Sphinx

This library is the code behind the @flying-sphinx@ gem. Its sole purpose is to connect Thinking Sphinx to the "Flying Sphinx Heroku addon":http://addons.heroku.com/flying_sphinx - and so you can just use Thinking Sphinx as normal on Heroku-hosted sites.

h2. Installation and Usage

This is all covered pretty well on "the Flying Sphinx site":http://flying-sphinx.com/docs, but if you're reading this on Github, you're probably keen on using this repository as the source instead of the gem. Here's the code snippet for your @Gemfile@:

<pre><code>gem 'flying-sphinx',
  :git    => 'https://github.com/flying-sphinx/flying-sphinx.git',
  :branch => 'master'</code></pre>

h2. Compatibility and Limitations

The current (2.x) releases support Thinking Sphinx v4+, ActiveRecord/Rails 3.2+, and Ruby 2.3+. Ruby 2.2.x will probably work well too, but is not tested against, and thus not officially supported.

If you are using older versions of any of these, please use v1.3.1 (which supports Thinking Sphinx v1.5+, ActiveRecord/Rails 2.3.6+, and Ruby 1.9.3+).

If you're still using Ruby 1.8.7, flying-sphinx 1.2.1 is the last release to support that.

h2. Contributing

Patches are indeed welcome - though I understand it's a little tricky to test them thoroughly. It's best to give your changes a spin on your Heroku app that's running Flying Sphinx (and if you don't have one of those, I'm a little confused as to why you're contributing).

API documentation is required - consider this paragraph a placeholder for that.

In the meantime, please keep in mind the following:

* Write tests using RSpec
* Keep your commits in a separate branch
* Don't change the version or History file in your feature branch - makes merging changes much easier.
